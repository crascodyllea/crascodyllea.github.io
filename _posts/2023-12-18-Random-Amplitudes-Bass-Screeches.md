This patch was made with Vital's random amplitudes phase distortion mode. The main LFO scans through oscillator 2’s wavetable position, giving more harmonic content for the RandAmp distortion during peaks. Comb filter and flanger both move to avoid consistent tonality, providing variation to patterns.

The patch isn't great, so I haven't put it up for download, but most of the sounds are usable. I'll revisit this idea soon with noise resampling and comb filters in the wavetable editor to create more uniformly noisy profiles and avoid mud introduced by resynthesising the OSC2 wavetable that becomes intrusive when the RandAmp position is being modulated only subtly.
