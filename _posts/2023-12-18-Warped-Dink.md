This patch’s generator is a barebones Ogun instance creating simple tonal metallic hits. It is imbued with additional harmonic complexity by a static phaser and then distorted relatively unpredictably by a ring modulator. The sound is passed through a tonal delay and a frequency shifter to fine-tune the character of the sound, before being shaped by two Love Philter-powered phase dispersers.

A patch in this style had been a goal of mine for a couple of months before really sitting down and getting to work on it earlier this year. While it isn’t as predictably controllable as I initially envisioned, I’m ultimately satisfied with the nature and variety of sounds it’s able to produce. Next on the horizon in this vein of metallic hit design is a similar patch build from the ground up with Karplus-Strong synthesis using FL’s Multiband Delay, a tool which I still don’t understand well enough to be confident sharing any of my experiments with it yet. Safe to say, however, is that this won’t be the last patch in this style. On the horizon for Dinkatuff itself are tasteful controls for Ogun’s built in unison, as well as an optional linearisation of the frequency shifter and ring modulator for cleaner automation in live applications. Dinkatuff will be made available in the future as part of a series including the Multiband Delay powered Dinkaton, and the effect chain Dinkatink.
